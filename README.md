Customization
Colors: Adjust background and text colors in css/custom.css.
Corners: Edit border-radius values in css/custom.css for a sharper or more rounded design.
Images and Icons: Replace or add files in the images/ folder and reference them in the CSS.
Shadows: Modify box-shadow values for a more pronounced or minimal look.

Compatibility
Tested with recent Plesk versions (e.g., Obsidian).
For older versions, you may need to tweak the CSS selectors. Use your browser’s DevTools to confirm class names if something isn’t styled correctly.
